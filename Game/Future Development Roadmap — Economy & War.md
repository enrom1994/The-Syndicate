Future Development Roadmap — Economy & War

Feature: War-Time Contraband Demand Spikes
Status: Planned
Priority: High (War Economy)

Description:
During active war phases, Black Market buyers pay increased rates for contraband items, reflecting heightened underground demand. This provides instant economic rewards for PvP, raids, and heists, allowing wars to partially fund themselves and reducing friction around upkeep and protection costs.

Design Goals:

Increase cash velocity during wars

Reward active PvP participation

Support defense, insurance, and protection spending

Avoid inflation or market abuse

Initial Implementation (Phase 1):

Apply temporary sell-price multipliers during war state:

Common contraband: 70% → 80%

Uncommon contraband: 75% → 85%

Rare contraband: 80% → 90%

System-controlled pricing (no player auctions)

Reverts automatically when war ends

Success Metrics:

Increased contraband sales during war

Higher protection/shield repurchase rates

Stable average player cash (no inflation spike)

Increased engagement during war windows

6️⃣ Strategic Framing (Do This When You Announce It)

When this eventually ships, frame it as:

🩸 War Drives Demand
Black Market buyers are paying top dollar for supplies during conflict.

Not:

“Prices increased”

“Economic modifier”

“Buff”

Always tie it to world logic, not systems.
