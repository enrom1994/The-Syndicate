Future Development Roadmap — Economy & War

Feature: War-Time Contraband Demand Spikes
Status: Planned
Priority: High (War Economy)

Description:
During active war phases, Black Market buyers pay increased rates for contraband items, reflecting heightened underground demand. This provides instant economic rewards for PvP, raids, and heists, allowing wars to partially fund themselves and reducing friction around upkeep and protection costs.

Design Goals:

Increase cash velocity during wars

Reward active PvP participation

Support defense, insurance, and protection spending

Avoid inflation or market abuse

Initial Implementation (Phase 1):

Apply temporary sell-price multipliers during war state:

Common contraband: 70% → 80%

Uncommon contraband: 75% → 85%

Rare contraband: 80% → 90%

System-controlled pricing (no player auctions)

Reverts automatically when war ends

Success Metrics:

Increased contraband sales during war

Higher protection/shield repurchase rates

Stable average player cash (no inflation spike)

Increased engagement during war windows

6️⃣ Strategic Framing (Do This When You Announce It)

When this eventually ships, frame it as:

🩸 War Drives Demand
Black Market buyers are paying top dollar for supplies during conflict.

Not:

“Prices increased”

“Economic modifier”

“Buff”

Always tie it to world logic, not systems.


Recommended Fee Structure (Ship This)
Flat Fee, Scales with Player Progress

Do not scale by target. Scale by attacker tier.

Example (clean and understandable):

Player Tier	PvP Cash Fee
Early game	$500
Mid game	$1,000
Late game	$2,000

Why this works:

Always affordable

Never ignorable

Predictable

Doesn’t punish weaker players disproportionately

This is roughly:

~1–3% of daily income

Comparable to a “meaningful click”

❌ What NOT to Do

% of cash (feels punitive)

Scaling by defender wealth (grief fuel)

TON or Diamonds (wrong emotional layer)

Zero-cost revenge (infinite loops)

💡 Revenge Fee

👉 Same fee as normal PvP

Do not discount revenge.
The emotional discount is enough.

2️⃣ Predicted Impact on PvP Frequency

Let’s be realistic.

Short-Term (First 48–72 Hours)

📉 PvP attempts drop ~20–30%

📈 PvP success rate increases

📈 Protection purchases increase

📈 Revenge usage increases

This is good.
You are filtering out low-intent noise.

Medium-Term (1–2 Weeks)

⚔️ Total PvP actions stabilize at ~85–90% of previous

😡 Rage attacks decrease

🎯 Targeted attacks increase

🔁 Feuds emerge (A ↔ B patterns)

This is where retention improves.

Monetization Side Effects (Important)

Protection & shields: +10–20% usage

Cash sinks stabilize inflation

Diamond rebuy loop improves indirectly

Players plan attacks instead of spamming

Net result:

Slightly fewer attacks, much higher-quality PvP

That’s exactly what you want for a long-running game.

3️⃣ War-Only PvP Rule Variants (This Is Where It Gets Fun)

War is where you can safely bend rules, because context justifies it.

The key principle:

War loosens constraints — it never removes them.

🔥 War Variant 1: Reduced PvP Fee (RECOMMENDED)

During war:

PvP cash fee reduced by 50%

Why:

Encourages aggression

Feels like “resources are flowing”

Still prevents spam

Example:

Normal: $1,000

War: $500

This alone will spike PvP.

🔥 War Variant 2: Limited Revenge Expansion

During war only:

Revenge window extended (e.g. 24h → 48h)

Still:

One revenge

Same fee

No chaining

This supports:

Long-running feuds

Multi-day wars

Emotional continuity

🔥 War Variant 3: Protection Tension (OPTIONAL, LATER)

Do not do this in v1, but note it for later:

Protection duration unchanged

But cooldown to re-buy protection increases during war

This creates:

Strategic vulnerability windows

High-value targets

More meaningful timing

Only add this once you’re confident.

🚫 What You Should NOT Change During War

Level gap rules ❌

Protection immunity ❌

PvP fee removal ❌

Free attacks ❌

War should feel dangerous, not chaotic.

4️⃣ Recommended Implementation Order
Ship Now

Flat cash PvP fee (tiered)

Same fee for revenge

No attacks vs protected players

Next War Patch

50% fee reduction during war

Extended revenge window during war

Everything else can wait.

5️⃣ How to Explain This to Players (Important)

Never say:

“We added a fee”

Say:

🗡️ Assassinations Require Resources
Attacking another player now costs cash.
During war, violence is cheaper.

That framing matters.

Final Operator Summary

You’re doing three smart things simultaneously:

Adding friction with purpose

Creating economic tension

Designing war as a ruleset, not a skin

This is exactly how sustainable PvP economies are built.
