## 💀 Dead / Obsolete usage
Items that serve little purpose or are quickly outclassed.

1.  **Fedora Hat**: +5 Defense is negligible compared to Armored Vest (+20). No secondary bonus like Silk Suit (+Income). *Suggestion: Add +Luck or +Respect Gain.*
2.  **Switchblade / Brass Knuckles**: Classic starter trash. They exist to be replaced.
3.  **Crooked Accountant**: The "-5% Upkeep" bonus is likely mathematically weak compared to just buying more income-generating assets, unless the player has a massive, unsustainable army.
4.  **Forged Documents**: Produced by Drivers, but "Smuggling Route" is already high tier. Might be overshadowed by "Whiskey Crate" volume production if math isn't perfectly balanced.

## 📉 Underused Assets
Mechanics that exist but aren't driving the core loop enough.

1.  **Getaway Driver**: The "+10% Escape Effect" is invisible stat power. Players prefer raw Attack/Defense. Needs better feedback or a specific heist that *requires* a driver to even attempt.
2.  **Consumables (Whiskey/Stash)**: Currently only used for *specific* attacks. Could be expanded to be temporary buffs for *any* attack (e.g., "Drink Whiskey for +10 Atk this turn").
3.  **Diamond Ring**: Low stats for a "Rare" item impossible to buy. Needs a buff to be a desirable drop.

## 💎 TON Drivers (Monetization Opportunities)
Items that are strong candidates for Real Money/TON sales.

1.  **Golden Revolver**: "Legendary" status, high stats. Perfect for a "Boss Starter Pack" ($9.99 TON).
2.  **Gold Watch**: +10% Income is a permanent passive buff. This is a classic "P2W" or "Premium" feature that players will pay for to compound earnings.
3.  **Personal Guard**: A single unit with massive stats. Ideal limited-time offer.
4.  **Professional Hitman**: High upkeep limits spamming, but selling a "Contract: 10 Hitmen" pack for Diamonds allows players to bypass the hiring cooldown or cash grind.
5.  **Safe Slots**: Already implemented, but critical. As players hoard cash/items, they *must* buy these.
6.  **Instant Production Finish**: Paying Diamonds to skip the 24h wait for "Morphine Vials" is a standard mobile game sink.
